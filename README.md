The repository contains the codes written in R and Python for a project where we proposed a novel method combining stability selection and ensemble learning for feature selection and prediction.

Abstract: Certain rare cancers such as ovarian or pancreatic cancer would benefit if detected
early at a stage when they are resectable. Unfortunately, approved biomarkers
for these cancers are not adequate for screening the general population, and it
is unlikely that a single marker will meet the performance criteria for screening.
Determining a combination of biomarkers for early detection of rare cancers is a
challenge. Often model selection suffers from overfitting in the discovery phase,
which leads to poor performance upon validation. Since ovarian cancer has a
poor prognosis, we aim to identify biomarkers that perform robustly in early
cancer detection discovery and validation phases. Stability selection methods
have been used to prevent overfitting and to reliably select truly expressed
biomarkers. Ensemble learning methods provide robust prediction results in the
face of model misspecification. We present a novel framework with a biomarker
selection stage with stability selection and prediction stage using an ensemble of
machine learning (ML) methods, namely the stability selection ensemble learning
(STABEL). The ensemble consists of random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Simulated
data, along with ovarian cancer data from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian
PLCO) Cancer Screening Trials are used to test the methodology. Our results
demonstrate the power of integrating ensemble learning with stability selection to
select cancer biomarkers and achieve strong predictive performance. The STABEL
technique outperforms or performs similarly to the existing methods in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, prediction accuracy, and area under the curve.

The main algorithm will be added here once the manuscript is accepted for publication.
